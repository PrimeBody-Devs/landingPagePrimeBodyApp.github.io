# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the improvements needed for the Hero Section of the PRIMEBODY landing page to enhance visual appeal, user engagement, and overall user experience. The improvements focus on better text readability, engaging animations, dynamic background options, and subtle visual effects that create a more immersive and professional presentation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a visitor to the PRIMEBODY landing page, I want the hero section text to be clearly readable against the background image, so that I can easily understand the main value proposition without straining my eyes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the hero section loads THEN the system SHALL display a dark gradient overlay over the background image
2. WHEN the gradient overlay is applied THEN the system SHALL ensure text contrast ratio meets WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 minimum)
3. WHEN viewing on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent text readability across all devices
4. IF the background image fails to load THEN the system SHALL display a fallback gradient background that maintains text readability

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a visitor to the PRIMEBODY landing page, I want to see smooth and engaging entrance animations when the hero section loads, so that I feel impressed by the professional presentation and am more likely to engage with the content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the hero section first loads THEN the system SHALL animate the main title with a fade-in and slide-up effect over 1.2 seconds
2. WHEN the title animation completes THEN the system SHALL animate the subtitle with a fade-in effect with a 0.3 second delay
3. WHEN the subtitle animation completes THEN the system SHALL animate the hero buttons with a slide-up and fade-in effect with a 0.2 second delay
4. WHEN animations are playing THEN the system SHALL use smooth easing functions (ease-out) for natural movement
5. IF the user has reduced motion preferences enabled THEN the system SHALL respect those settings and show content without animations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a visitor to the PRIMEBODY landing page, I want the option to see a dynamic video background instead of a static image, so that I experience a more engaging and modern presentation that reflects the innovative nature of the fitness app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the hero section loads THEN the system SHALL provide the capability to display either a video or image background
2. WHEN a video background is used THEN the system SHALL autoplay the video without sound and loop continuously
3. WHEN the video background is loading THEN the system SHALL display the static image as a fallback until the video is ready
4. WHEN on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL use the static image background to preserve bandwidth and battery life
5. IF the video fails to load THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to the static image background
6. WHEN using video background THEN the system SHALL ensure the video file is optimized for web (under 5MB, compressed)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a visitor to the PRIMEBODY landing page, I want to see subtle floating particle effects in the hero section, so that I experience a dynamic and visually appealing presentation that enhances the modern, tech-forward brand image.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the hero section loads THEN the system SHALL display subtle floating particles across the hero area
2. WHEN particles are displayed THEN the system SHALL animate them with slow, continuous floating motion
3. WHEN particles move THEN the system SHALL use different sizes, opacities, and speeds to create depth and visual interest
4. WHEN particles reach screen boundaries THEN the system SHALL seamlessly wrap them to the opposite side
5. IF the user is on a low-performance device THEN the system SHALL reduce or disable particle effects to maintain smooth performance
6. WHEN particles are active THEN the system SHALL ensure they don't interfere with text readability or user interactions
7. WHEN the user scrolls away from the hero section THEN the system SHALL pause or reduce particle animations to optimize performance
