# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Set up CSS foundation for hero section improvements
  - Add CSS custom properties for animation timing and easing functions
  - Create base keyframe animations for fade-in and slide-up effects
  - Implement gradient overlay styles with proper z-index layering
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.4_

- [x] 2. Implement gradient overlay for better text readability
  - Add CSS pseudo-element for gradient overlay on hero section
  - Configure gradient colors and opacity values for optimal contrast
  - Test and adjust gradient to meet WCAG AA contrast requirements
  - Add fallback background color for cases where gradient fails
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [ ] 3. Create animation system for hero content
- [x] 3.1 Implement CSS keyframe animations
  - Write fadeInUp keyframe animation for title and buttons
  - Write fadeIn keyframe animation for subtitle
  - Create CSS classes for animation states (initial hidden state and animated state)
  - Add smooth easing functions using cubic-bezier curves
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 3.2 Add JavaScript animation controller
  - Create Intersection Observer to detect when hero section is visible
  - Implement animation trigger logic with proper timing delays
  - Add classes to DOM elements to trigger CSS animations
  - Implement prefers-reduced-motion media query detection and handling
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.5_

- [ ] 4. Implement video background system with fallback
- [x] 4.1 Create HTML structure for video background
  - Add video element with proper attributes (autoplay, muted, loop, playsinline)
  - Structure HTML to support both video and image backgrounds
  - Add proper source elements for video format support
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 4.2 Implement video loading and fallback logic
  - Write JavaScript to detect video loading success/failure
  - Implement mobile device detection to use image background
  - Add error event handlers for graceful fallback to image
  - Create loading state management for smooth transitions
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6_

- [ ] 5. Create particle system for visual effects
- [ ] 5.1 Implement particle system class and logic
  - Create ParticleSystem JavaScript class with initialization methods
  - Implement particle creation with randomized properties (size, position, speed, opacity)
  - Write animation loop using requestAnimationFrame for smooth movement
  - Add boundary detection and wrapping logic for continuous movement
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 5.2 Add performance optimization and device detection
  - Implement device performance detection (CPU cores, memory)
  - Add logic to reduce or disable particles on low-performance devices
  - Create intersection observer to pause particles when hero section not visible
  - Ensure particles don't interfere with text readability or interactions
  - _Requirements: 4.5, 4.6, 4.7_

- [ ] 6. Integrate all components and test functionality
  - Combine all hero section improvements into cohesive system
  - Test animation sequence timing and ensure proper layering
  - Verify video background works with particle system overlay
  - Test responsive behavior across different screen sizes
  - Validate accessibility features and reduced motion preferences
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.5, 3.4, 4.5_

- [ ] 7. Add error handling and performance monitoring
  - Implement try-catch blocks for animation and particle system initialization
  - Add console warnings for fallback scenarios (video load failure, etc.)
  - Create performance monitoring to detect animation frame drops
  - Add cleanup functions for particle system when component unmounts
  - _Requirements: 3.5, 4.5, 4.7_

- [ ] 8. Write unit tests for hero section functionality
  - Create tests for animation trigger logic and timing
  - Test video fallback scenarios and error handling
  - Write tests for particle system performance optimization
  - Test device detection and accessibility preference handling
  - _Requirements: 2.5, 3.4, 3.5, 4.5_
